# Changelog

All notable changes to the Tauraro language and compiler (`tauraroc`) are
documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versioning follows the pre-0.1 policy described in
[docs/dev/00_versioning_policy.md](docs/dev/00_versioning_policy.md): in the
current `0.0.x` phase, **any** version bump may contain breaking changes, and
there is no deprecation period.

## [Unreleased]

Work in progress on the production-readiness roadmap (formal ownership/safety
spec, automated regression suite + CI, incremental compilation, and a batch of
codegen-safety / diagnostics / stdlib / tooling improvements). Entries will be
added here as each phase lands.

### Fixed
- **Latent runtime bug in `Dict`/`Map[K,bool]`/sets:** `Dict_has` reported key
  presence as `Dict_get(d,key) != NULL`, so any key stored with a `false`/`NULL`
  value was wrongly reported **absent**. This silently broke every false-valued
  dict/set — and, crucially, made the compiler's own interprocedural
  `consumes(fn,i)` ownership summary (`fn_param_consumes`, a `Map[str,bool]`)
  invisible. Fixed to walk the bucket chain by key (`runtime/tauraro_rt.h`). The
  compiler's other `Map[str,bool]` were unaffected because they only ever store
  `true`, which is why this went unnoticed.
- **F-2 borrow-vs-consume leak closed.** With `consumes(fn,i)` finally visible, a
  new post-pass `apply_borrow_drops` (`src/sema.tr`) reclaims a fresh owned local
  that is passed only to functions that BORROW it — the auto-drop the conservative
  class-arg escape used to suppress (a leak). It is additive and strictly
  conservative (adds a drop only for a local proven not-consumed), a `.free()` call
  is now detected as consuming its receiver (so a consumed local is never
  double-dropped), and a pure-scalar return (`return x.score()`) is correctly read
  as a borrow. Verified: `f_owned_use` `LIVE 0`, soundness 18/18+8/8, gen2≡gen3
  fixpoint. Promoted to the `CORE` fuzz gate.
- A method call on a receiver that names **no defined type or value** (e.g. a
  renamed/removed type used as a static receiver, `JsonValue.init_object()` after
  `std.encoding.json` dropped `JsonValue`) silently emitted a bogus free
  `init_object(JsonValue)` call, producing an `implicit declaration` C compile
  error with no source-level diagnostic. Such calls are now a hard **`[E-1]`**
  error naming the unresolved receiver (`src/sema.tr`, new `_is_known_type_name`
  guard). Module-statics (`Str`/`Clock`/`OS`), module globals, instances, generic
  parameters, and all builtin generics are unaffected (self-host `--check` clean,
  fixpoint holds). Regression: `tests/soundness/reject/unknown_receiver_method.tr`.
- The static constructors `Option.some(x)` / `Result.ok(x)` / `Result.err(x)`
  dropped their payload type when assigned to an **unannotated** local, so
  `mut o = Option.some(5)` inferred a bare `Option` (not `Option[int]`) and a
  following `o.unwrap()` mis-resolved to a bogus free `unwrap(o)` call. The
  lowercase constructors now carry the concrete payload type (`src/sema.tr`,
  guarded by a static receiver so the instance `.ok()`/`.err()` accessors are
  unaffected). Regression: `tests/regression/option_result_ctor_infer.tr`.
- Whole-number float literals (e.g. `7.0`) were emitted into generated C
  without a `.`/exponent marker (`%.17g` of `7.0` is `"7"`), so expressions
  like `7.0 / 2.0` silently became integer division (`3` instead of `3.5`).
  Fixed in `_tr_float_to_c_lit` (`runtime/tauraro_rt.h`) by appending `.0`
  when no float marker is present.
- Fixed broken escaped-quote f-strings (`f"... \"...\" ..."`) in
  `std/test/mod.tr` that caused 39 cascading parse errors and made the
  `TestRunner` helper unusable.

- Escape analysis (`mark_escaped_str_args` / `mark_escaped_coll_args` in
  `src/sema.tr`) previously had a silent wildcard `case _: pass` that skipped
  several `HirExpr` variants, so `str`/collection locals referenced only
  through an f-string interpolation, a closure capture, a list/generator
  comprehension, a slice, or a `super` method call were not excluded from
  auto-drop — a potential use-after-free / double-free. All such variants are
  now walked explicitly, and the catch-all is replaced by an exhaustive list
  of leaf/literal variants so a future new `HirExpr` variant is a compile
  error rather than a silent miss.
- Storing the same `str` local under two keys of a `Dict[K,str]`/`Map[K,str]`
  (or storing one that is later auto-dropped) double-freed / use-after-freed
  at dict teardown: `dict_val_arg` boxed the value with `_tr_str_box` but no
  `_tr_str_retain`, so multiple boxes aliased one reference. Dict/Map string
  values now retain on insert (`_tr_str_box(_tr_str_retain(...))`), mirroring
  `List_TrStr_append`, and `mark_escaped_str_args` no longer excludes the
  value arg from auto-drop. Fresh string values (concat/call/method results)
  are hoisted to a temp and released after the set so reference counts stay
  balanced.
- `extern` (`_tr_*` runtime-helper) calls passing a fresh `str` argument
  (concat/call/method result) leaked the temporary `TrStr`: `gen_args_extern`
  extracted `.data` via a bare `_tr_strz()` and discarded the struct. Fresh
  string arguments are now hoisted to a temp and released by the enclosing
  statement's `flush_wraps`, matching `gen_args` for normal calls.

### Changed
- **Async/await is now a green-thread runtime.** `async def` / `await` no
  longer spawn an OS thread per `await` and block the caller. Instead each task
  is a lightweight **stackful coroutine** (Windows Fibers / POSIX `ucontext`)
  with its own small stack, and `await` is a cheap context switch driven by a
  cooperative scheduler. A single OS thread runs many tasks; `await` suspends
  the caller and resumes it with the callee's result without blocking. The
  scheduler integrates the `_TrIOPoll` reactor (epoll / IOCP-select / kqueue),
  so an `await` on a socket parks the task on fd-readiness and yields the worker
  — true non-blocking I/O, no thread blocked per connection. Nested `await`
  chains, cooperative `Coro.sleep_ms` (timer-parked) and `Coro.yield_now`, and
  reactor-based `Coro.await_readable`/`await_writable` are provided via the new
  `std/async/coro` module. (`spawn`/`task_group` keep OS-thread parallelism for
  CPU-bound work; multi-core green-thread scheduling is future work.)
- Debug builds (`--debug`) now emit C `#line N "source.tr"` directives mapping
  each generated statement back to its original Tauraro source file and line,
  so GCC diagnostics and GDB backtraces reference the `.tr` source rather than
  the generated C. Line directives are off by default (non-debug output is
  unchanged). Paths are emitted with forward slashes for cross-platform C
  string compatibility.
- Incremental compilation: the build now compiles each module's generated C to
  its own object file (`gcc -c`) and links the objects, reusing the cached `.o`
  for any module whose generated C is byte-identical to the previous build (and
  whose shared headers / compile flags are unchanged). A clean rebuild after
  editing a single module now recompiles only the affected module(s) instead of
  the whole program. The `build/` directory is kept populated between builds as
  the object cache (it is no longer wiped when `-o` is given). Verified
  correctness-preserving: an all-cache-reuse build is byte-identical to a
  from-scratch build.
- Parser diagnostics now report a precise column and a source-code snippet
  with a caret, in the style `file:line:col: error: <msg>` followed by the
  offending source line and a `^` under the exact column, then the `FIX:`
  hint. The lexer tracks per-token columns (`token_cols`) alongside lines;
  the parser is given the source text and renders the snippet. (Column info
  is diagnostic-only and never affects codegen.)

### Added
- Bidirectional FFI / library export: an `export def` function is given C-ABI
  external linkage (`__declspec(dllexport)` on Windows, default visibility on
  ELF/Mach-O via the new `TR_EXPORT` macro). The new `tauraroc --lib` mode
  builds a shared library (`.dll`/`.so`) instead of an executable (compiling
  every module `-fPIC` and linking `-shared`) and emits a self-contained C
  header declaring the exported functions, so C/Rust/etc. consumers can call
  into Tauraro code. Verified end-to-end (and in CI) by a C program linking the
  generated library through the generated header. (Exports with primitive /
  pointer signatures are fully self-contained; signatures using Tauraro struct
  types like `TrStr`/`Result` still require the runtime header — a documented
  v1 limitation.)
- `std/encoding/toml.tr`: a TOML parser and serializer (`TomlValue` tagged
  tree + `Toml.parse`/`Toml.stringify`), modeled on `std/encoding/json.tr`.
  Supports comments, bare/quoted keys, basic & literal strings, integers
  (with `_` separators) / floats / booleans, arrays, inline tables, and
  `[table]` / `[a.b.c]` nested table headers; round-trips. (YAML, a regex
  backtracking engine, and other encodings remain deferred.)
- `tauraroc fmt [-w] <file>`: a source formatter that re-emits canonically
  formatted Tauraro, **preserving comments** (the lexer records them out-of-band
  so the parser/codegen are unaffected). Standalone comments stay on their own
  line; trailing comments stay attached to their code line. Binary/unary
  sub-expressions are conservatively parenthesized so the output always
  re-parses to the same AST. The formatter is idempotent (`fmt(fmt(x)) ==
  fmt(x)`, verified on all formattable example files and in CI) and refuses to
  rewrite a file containing a construct it cannot yet render (rather than
  risk corrupting it).
- `tauraroc lint <file>`: runs module resolution + semantic analysis and
  reports warnings/errors without producing an executable.
- CI / `scripts/run_tests.*` now include a formatter idempotency check.
- `tests/lang/` and `tests/regression/` regression test suites (9 files,
  190 assertions) covering core language, collections, strings, classes &
  enums, error handling, concurrency, the #52/#54 string-collection fixes,
  the Phase 4 escape-walker variants, and the Phase 5 Dict-value retain fix,
  using `std/test`'s `TestRunner`.
- `scripts/run_tests.sh` / `scripts/run_tests.ps1` to run the suite via
  `tauraroc --run`.
- CI now runs the regression suite on every platform after building
  `tauraroc` (`.github/workflows/build.yml`).

## [0.0.8]

**Tauraro becomes a batteries-included, cross-platform toolchain.** Full notes in
[`note.md`](note.md).

### Added
- **Bundled toolchain (zig).** The release SDK ships a `zig/` folder beside the compiler
  (clang code generator + `lld` linker + a libc for every target), auto-detected at
  startup. `--backend llvm` and `--target` now work with **no system compiler, no LLVM,
  and no per-target sysroot** to install.
- **Cross-compilation — `--target <name|triple>`, on both the C and LLVM backends.**
  Linux (x86_64/arm64/arm32/riscv64), Windows (x64/arm64), macOS, Android, iOS,
  WebAssembly (`wasm`, `wasm-wasi`), and bare-metal (`embedded-arm/arm64/riscv32/riscv64`),
  or a raw LLVM triple. Hosted targets need no sysroot (zig bundles the libc). `--static`
  produces fully static binaries (musl on Linux).
- **WebAssembly is a first-class target.** `--backend llvm --target wasm-wasi` emits a
  runnable `.wasm`; the runtime gained a WASI profile (single-threaded, no sockets/subprocess).
- **`--no-heap`** — a compile-time zero-heap guarantee for bare metal: the compiler rejects
  every heap-allocating construct with `[H-1]`. New `examples/freestanding/zero_heap/`.
- **`-d <dir>`** to choose the output directory (default: the current working directory,
  consistent across all backends).

### Changed
- **LLVM backend self-hosts and is faster than C on most benchmarks** (a `getelementptr`
  codegen fix unblocked auto-vectorization: MatMul ~4×, Collatz ~3×). It compiles the whole
  compiler and emits byte-identical C to the reference build.
- **Bare-metal works via the bundled zig** (`zig cc -target thumb-freestanding-eabi …`) —
  no dedicated `arm-none-eabi-gcc` required. `TAURARO_BARE` was split into orthogonal
  `NO_LIBC`/`NO_THREADS`/`NO_NET`/`NO_SUBPROCESS` switches (bare-metal behaves identically).
- Host builds prefer a fast system `gcc`/`clang` and fall back to bundled `zig cc`.

### Fixed
- Three C-backend bugs found via the `LLVM ≡ C` differential oracle (interface retain,
  missing `_trdrop` for `free()`-owning classes, undefined `_tr_rt_str_new`); wildcard-match
  over-release in the shared LIR lowering; host-vs-target link flags (Winsock/output
  extension); the WASI `__main_void` entry glue.

### Docs
- New [Compiling, Backends & Cross-Compilation](docs/lang/22_compiling_and_cross_compilation.md)
  guide; updated intro, README, and the bare-metal guide.

## [0.0.5] - in development

### Memory model (TrStr migration, items #48-#58)
- Migrated `str`/`String` to a refcounted `TrStr` (`.data`/`.rc`) representation
  across literals, call sites, FFI/extern boundaries, and the standard library
  (`Str`, `StringBuilder`, `Fmt`, JSON/Base64/Hex/URL/DateTime).
- `List[str]` / `Dict[K,str]` / `Set[str]` specializations migrated to
  `List_TrStr` / `Dict_free_strval`, fixing use-after-free and double-free bugs
  in string-valued collections.
- Added collection escape-analysis (`coll_escaped`) and string escape-analysis
  (`str_escaped`) passes in `src/sema.tr` to drive auto-drop (RAII-lite) of
  non-escaping `List`/`Vec`/`Dict`/`Map`/`Set`/`str` locals.
- Added block-id (block-stack) tracking for correct per-branch drop insertion.
- Fixed numerous wrap-hoist leaks (`wrapstr`/`flush_wraps`/`strz`) for fresh
  TrStr temporaries in concat, method calls, and return/assign/condition
  positions.
- Added `.free()`/`.dispose()` to `Pair`, `StrPair`, `Triple`, `HttpHeader`,
  `Url`, `TimeDelta`, `DateTime`, `Date`, `Time`, `HttpConn`, `HttpResponse`,
  `JsonValue`.
- Net effect on the watax HTTP benchmark: residual per-request allocation
  dropped from multi-KB to roughly 50-300B/req with no crashes at 25k+
  requests / concurrency=500.

### Compiler / safety
- Implemented `extern "CPP":` as an ABI synonym for `extern "C":` (real C++
  interop still crosses a C boundary).
- Added `inspect(T)` compile-time reflection (types, functions, classes,
  enums, interfaces, docstrings).
- Added variadic function parameters (`args...`).
- Implemented nested (Java-style) `class`/`def`/`enum`/`interface`/`extend`
  declarations inside `main()`.
- Enforced `unsafe:` blocks around raw-pointer `.write()` calls across
  `std/` (json, map, path, collections/list, resolver, codegen).
- Improved parser error reporting with current-file tracking.

### Ecosystem
- watax (Axum-style web framework): reactor-based concurrency
  (`IOPoll`/epoll/IOCP/kqueue), thread-per-connection and reactor-pool
  listeners, templa template engine with `{% extends %}`/`{% block %}`
  inheritance, static file serving, JSON API helpers, CORS middleware,
  graceful shutdown, `TestClient`.
- taupkg package manager: semver + lockfile, local/git dependencies,
  `cp_r` packaging fixes.
- Full rewrite of `docs/lang/*`, `docs/std/*`, and new `docs/dev/*`
  contributor/internals guide.

### Build
- Fixed bootstrap binary output location (`build.sh`/`build.ps1` now move
  `src/build/tauraroc[.exe]` to the working directory if the compiler still
  places it there).
- Self-locating compiler (`_tr_exe_dir()`) so bare-name PATH invocation finds
  `runtime/`/`std/` relative to the executable.
