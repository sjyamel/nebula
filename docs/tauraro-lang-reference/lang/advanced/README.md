# Advanced Docs Index

This directory covers advanced Tauraro topics. Core Tauraro development — writing programs, using the standard library, building with modules, concurrency — does not require any of this. These docs exist for when you hit a wall and need a deeper mental model, or when you are building libraries and infrastructure rather than applications.

## Contents

| Doc | Topic | When You Need It |
|-----|-------|-----------------|
| [09 — Safety Specification](09_safety_spec.md) | **Normative**: the ARC-floor invariants, what `--strict` proves/elides, the elision-soundness theorem, and how every guarantee is verified (corpus + differential oracle + ASan) | Understanding exactly what Tauraro guarantees, and what it does not yet |
| [01 — Lifetimes & Borrow Checking](01_lifetimes.md) | `ref`/`mut ref`, regions (`from`), `where … outlives`, regions on enum/interface, the `[B-*]`/`[L-*]` checks | Opt-in zero-copy with a compile-time guarantee under `--strict` |
| [08 — Zero-Copy Guide](08_zero_copy.md) | When zero-copy wins (StrView, borrowed payloads, dict borrows) vs parity, best practices, numbers | Removing copies/allocations/refcount traffic on hot paths |
| [02 — Advanced Ownership](02_advanced_ownership.md) | Move, borrow, Shared deep dive | Understanding M-2 errors; shared mutable state |
| [03 — Channel Select](03_channel_select.md) | `select:` for multiplexed channels | Fan-in, timeouts, non-blocking channel ops |
| [04 — Generators](04_generators.md) | Not currently supported — use list comprehensions / manual loops | — |
| [05 — Decorators](05_decorators.md) | `@inline`, `@hot`, `@property`, `@value_type`, custom decorators, and the bare-metal decorators | Compile-time code annotation and transformation |
| [11 — Bare-Metal & Freestanding](11_bare_metal.md) | The `std`/`--no-std`/`--freestanding` runtime tiers, cross-compilation, `@entry`/`@allocator`/`@output`, `@section`/`@naked`/`@interrupt`, `--emit-ld`, `std/hal/mmio` device drivers | Cross-compiling to ARM/RISC-V; writing MCU firmware, drivers, or a kernel — 100% in Tauraro |
| [10 — Macros](10_macros.md) | `macro def` + `@` — compile-time code generation via f-string templates over an `item` reflection (`@derive_eq`, etc.) | Generating boilerplate (derives, wrappers) from a declaration's shape |
| [06 — Sendable](06_sendable.md) | Thread-safety enforcement via the `Sendable` interface | Passing types across threads without data races |
| [07 — Concurrency Guide](07_concurrency_guide.md) | All concurrency models, primitives, decision matrix, best-practice combinations | Choosing the right model; building servers/parallel work; see `examples/concurrency/` |
