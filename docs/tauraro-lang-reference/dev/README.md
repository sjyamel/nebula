# Tauraro Developer & Contributor Documentation

This section is for people who want to **work on the Tauraro compiler itself**,
**contribute fixes to `src/`/`std/`/`runtime/`**, or **build and publish their
own libraries** with `taupkg`. If you just want to *use* the language, see the
[Language Documentation](../lang/README.md) and [Standard Library
Documentation](../std/README.md) instead.

## Suggested Reading Order

**New compiler contributor:** 01 → 02 → 03 → 04 → 06
**Library author (taupkg):** 05 → 03 (for memory rules) → 06
**Fixing a specific bug:** jump to 06 first to check if it's a known pitfall, then 01/03/04 for the relevant subsystem
